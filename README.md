#Description

SVG_Logo_Maker

For this application I needed to created a SVG Logo Maker that used tests and user input. The tests were created to check if the following svgs will render using jest and inquirer packages from npmjs.com/package/. The application used switchcase prompt questions to get input from users and render an automated SVG file based on their choices for the text and the shape. The properities of render(), describe(), expect(), writeFile(), and etc. were used to get the input data and render the user input data.

#Mock_UP

#Usage

Further additions to this application would be adding more prompts to add styles to the text, change the size of the text or image, or create more abstract shapes. The installed packages are from https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest and 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4 and the documentation used for SVG was from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial .
